# Cuisine Compass Resturant Finder
Using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, our team developed a website to help users find restaurants within their city. The website allows users to input the name of the city they are in, which will open up a separate page. This second page will display a list of restaurants with a map that users can use to search for the restaurants location.
